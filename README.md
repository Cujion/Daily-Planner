## Description
* This is a Daily Organizing Planner that allows you to plan out your daily schedule and save that input to your local storage upon clicking the save icon on the right side of each section. This script uses Dayjs to update the local date and time in order to color coordinate each time slot. Green representing future hours, Red representing current hour and Grey representing past time. I also included a clear button in the header section to clear out the text input field along with your local storage. This webpage uses bootstrap for styling and layout of the page, external font styling, Jquery library, and utilizes local storage to save data to your local machine in order to update the planner on page reload.
